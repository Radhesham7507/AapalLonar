        <p> 	The Shiva Temple at Lonar, located in the Buldhana district of Maharashtra, India, is an ancient temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. This temple is notable for its proximity to the Lonar Crater, which is one of the world's largest basaltic impact craters and is believed to have been created by a meteorite impact around 52,000 ± 6,000 years ago.
